# GifTastic

This is the GifTastic Projet!

## Getting Started

This page is sports themed. It loads with three buttons that will populate the page with 10 Gifs using the GIPHY API.
You can also add any sports related gif (or any gif for that matter!) by entering the topic into the text field and clicking the add button. This will create a new button with the topic of your choice that, once selected, will populate the page with 10 gifs related to that topic! Each gif has been filtered to a rating of "G" and whose animation will start and stop on every click.

## Installing

All you need to get started is a browser with a working internet connection!
